/**
 * Creates an observable that emits incrementing numbers, starting at `0`, over time.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Its like {@link index/interval}, but you can specify when
 * should the emissions start (either by delay or exact date).</span>
 *
 * ![](timer.png)
 *
 * Will return an observable that emits incrementing numbers over time, starting a `0`,
 * or just a single number `0` after a specified delay or start time.
 *
 * If no scheduler is provided, {@link index/asyncScheduler} will be the assumed default.
 *
 * When the first value of `0` is emitted is determined by a calculation based off of the
 * `dueTime`:
 *
 * 1. If the `dueTime` is a *valid* `Date` object, the first emission will be after a delay
 * calculated by subtracting the current timestamp (provided by the scheduler), from the numeric
 * value of the `Date`, which will be an epoch number in milliseconds.
 * 2. If the `dueTime` is a number, the first emission will be after a delay equal to that number.
 * 3. If the result of either 1 or 2 above is negative, that is the `dueTime` is a `Date` in the
 * past, OR a negative number, the result is the first emission will be scheduled after a delay
 * of `0`.
 *
 * When subsequent values are emitted is determined by the `period` argument:
 *
 * 1. If their is no `period` argument, there will be no further emissions.
 * 2. If the `period` argument is `0`, each new emission will be scheduled with a delay of `0`.
 * 3. If the `period` argument is a postive number, each new emission will be scheduled with a
 * delay equal to that number.
 * 4. If the `period` argument is negative, there will be no further emissions.
 *
 * **Known Issues**:
 *
 * If a `scheduler` is provided that returns a timsstamp other than an epoch from `now()`, and
 * a `Date` object is passed to the `dueTime` argument, the calculation for when the first emission
 * should occur will be incorrect. In this case, it would be best to do your own calculations
 * ahead of time, and pass a `number` in as the `dueTime`.
 *
 * Once the first value is emitted, if a `period` was provided
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Wait 3 seconds and start another observable
 *
 * You might want to use `timer` to delay subscription to an
 * observable by a set amount of time. Here we use a timer with
 * {@link concatMapTo} or {@link concatMap} in order to wait
 * a few seconds and start a subscription to a source.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { timer, of } from 'rxjs';
 * import { concatMapTo } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * // This could be any observable
 * const source = of(1, 2, 3);
 *
 * const result = timer(3000).pipe(
 *   concatMapTo(source)
 * )
 * .subscribe(console.log);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Take all of the values until the start of the next minute
 *
 * Using the a date as the trigger for the first emission, you can
 * do things like wait until midnight to fire an event, or in this case,
 * wait until a new minute starts (chosen so the example wouldn't take
 * too long to run) in order to stop watching a stream. Leveraging
 * {@link takeUntil}.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { interval, timer } from 'rxjs';
 * import { takeUntil } from 'rxjs/operators';
 *
 * // Build a Date object that marks the
 * // next minute.
 * const currentDate = new Date();
 * const startOfNextMinute = new Date(
 *   currentDate.getFullYear(),
 *   currentDate.getMonth(),
 *   currentDate.getDate(),
 *   currentDate.getHours(),
 *   currentDate.getMinutes() + 1,
 * )
 *
 * // This could be any observable stream
 * const source = interval(1000);
 *
 * const result = source.pipe(
 *   takeUntil(timer(startOfNextMinute))
 * );
 *
 * result.subscribe(console.log);
 * ```
 *
 * ### Start an interval that starts right away
 *
 * Since {@link index/interval} waits for the passed delay before starting,
 * sometimes that's not ideal. You may want to start an interval immediately.
 * `timer` works well for this. Here we have both side-by-side so you can
 * see them in comparison.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { timer, interval } from 'rxjs';
 *
 * timer(0, 1000).subscribe(n => console.log('timer', n));
 * interval(1000).subscribe(n => console.log('interval', n));
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link index/interval}
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param dueTime The initial delay time specified as a Date object or as an integer denoting
 * milliseconds to wait before emitting the first value of `0`.
 * @param periodOrScheduler The period of time between emissions of the
 * subsequent numbers.
 * @param scheduler The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for scheduling
 * the emission of values, and providing a notion of "time".
 * @return An Observable that emits a `0` after the
 * `dueTime` and ever increasing numbers after each `period` of time
 * thereafter.
